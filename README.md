# xcall-sample-dapp

This sample dapp is intended to run locally in a machine that has a local ICON Network, an EVM chain and a relayer running locally and has been setup using the [e2edemo](https://github.com/icon-project/btp2/tree/main/e2edemo) of the [btp2](https://github.com/icon-project/btp2) repository.

In order for this dapp to run correctly you have to first copy into this project root folder the `deployments.json` file that gets generated in the `e2edemo` root folder after succesfully setting up the environment.
